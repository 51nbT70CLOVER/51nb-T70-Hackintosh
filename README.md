# 51nb-T70-Hackintosh
Install macOS (Catalina?) on your 51nb T70 frankenpads.

Not tested. Messy configuration. Install on your own risk. If it works it works. YMMV.

## What (should) work:
QE/CI, Sleep, USB

## What doesn't seem to work:
Brightness control

## Future maintaince
Not gonna promise anything here. I don't own the hardware. If it works for you enjoy it, if it doesn't try to improve it on your own :)
